      			<p>I was born and raised in England. In 2015, my family and I relocated to New York. In 2020, I moved to Indiana to study at Purdue.</p>
      			<p>My interest in computing lasts as long as I can remember. My first clear memory of interacting with a computer was the day that my family had a new Dell desktop commputer delivered when I was 3 or 4 years old. I would spend hours at a time exploring every corner of the (at the time) brand new Windows XP operating system.</p>
      			<p>At the age of around 10, I wanted to start building my own website. I initially started using no-code website builders, but eventually moved on to learning HTML, which was my first taste of programming.</p>
      			<p>At the age of 13, I built my first desktop computer. It was cheap and fairly low-spec, but the process of building the machine likely changed the course of my life and career aspirations, and built the foundations for my computer hardware knowledge.</p>
      			<p>When I got to high school, I finally had the opportunity to take computer science classes (AP CS A & CS Principles). These courses were my first introduction to the study of computing in an academic environment, and helped solidify my decision to study computer science at college.</p>
      			<p>Since then, I have gone on to study computer science for 5 semesters at university, complete 3 tech internships, and work on countless (mostly unfinished) side projects to learn new skills and technologies.</p>
